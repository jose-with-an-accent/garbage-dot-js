# garbage.js

Yet another Javascript framework (not really, just a bunch of code that could be used for different things).

This currently only holds a demo project (an intro website) that uses it, but in the future will be decoupled from the project and actually organized.

- ❌ Used in production 
- ❌ stable

## Structure
There are several things that are tightly integrated - the use of a navbar/navigation thing, and others.


## Objectives
- Make small projects with as small amount of code as possible while keeping SPA-like components.
- Have some degree of component reusability.
- Have simple functions and extensibility.

## Caveats
Everything i guess lol. I'm not really going to be supporting or using this too much, so I guess this is just like a learning project or a demo.

## Getting Started
Include Loader.js into your main file
